<p>Police violence has remained a persistent issue in the United States, capturing national attention year after year. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/">Recent data from The <em>Washington Post</a></em> tracked fatal police shootings from 2015 to present and found underlying trends in the demographics that are the victims of police shootings, the scant use of body cameras and killings of unarmed or not deadly armed individuals. The data I arm using for this project runs from 2015 to the end of October 2024.</p>

<p>Police shootings from 2015 to present, according to <em>The Washington Post</em>, have crept above 1,000 in 2022 and 2023, but <a href="https://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/peter-moskos">Peter Moskos</a>, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice specializing in policing and police accountability, urges caution in interpreting these numbers, noting, the slight increase isn’t substantial if you factor in population growth.</p>

<p>Moskos also notes the decrease in police shootings in the past few decades. He notes the Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Garner, which criminalized police from shooting a fleeing suspect unless they had probable cause. Since the 80s, Moskos estimates police have shot 80% less people.</p>

<p>“We're documenting if you fire your gun (more),” Moskos said. “You have to tell us. That was a new concept, and it had beneficial effects in a lot of police departments back then and again.</p>

<p>But, still, Moskos criticizes the underreporting of police departments. According to a 2022 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/fatal-police-shootings-unreported/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"><em>Washington Post</em></a> investigation only a third of fatal police shootings were reported.</p>

<p>“We're horrible at keeping criminal justice data,” Moskos said. “After Ferguson, when people started caring, I would get calls wondering how many people the cops killed last year. And I’d say we don't know, because the UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting Program) had a number that we knew was an undercount, but we didn't know how much. And then it turned out to be a dramatic underground, only 50% that wasn't being counted, and that's because of the, you know, the messiness of data collection.”</p>

<p>Moskos floated roughly doubling the total of tracked police killings to have a more accurate numbers, but said it's “an outrage that we don't manage basic criminal data keeping for this stuff at a federal level.” He mentions, even any federal precedent would be hard to enforce for the 17,000 police departments around the country that the federal government doesn't have direct control over.</p>

<p>“Underreporting isn’t just a data problem; it’s a governance problem,” <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/jessie-trudeau">Jesse Trudeau</a>, an assistant professor of political science at Syracuse’s Maxwell School, said. “Without accurate data, we’re flying blind in addressing the real scope of police violence.”</p>

<p>Moskos pointed to societal polarization and shifts in crime patterns as potential contributors to overall police shootings, though he acknowledged that these factors require further study. This consistency in numbers raises questions about whether the systems designed to address police violence are truly effective.</p>

<p>A closer look at the data reveals troubling patterns about who is most affected by police violence. Younger individuals, particularly young men of color, face the highest risks. According to a 2024 article by the National Library of Medicine, which analyzed <em>The Washington Post</em> data Black people make up 13% of the U.S. population but accounted for 26% of police shootings and 36% of unarmed shootings. The median age of victims was 35 and over 95% of the victims were men. Per Moskos, this disparity cannot be fully understood without considering structural inequality.</p>

<p>“There’s no denying the racial disparities in police violence, but socioeconomic status plays a huge role too,” Moskos said. “Communities with high poverty rates see more visible crime, which attracts more policing. But that increased presence often comes with higher risks of violence. If we don’t address these root causes, we’re just putting a Band-Aid on the problem.”</p>

<p>Trudeau, who researches policing and crime, echoed these concerns and emphasized the role of socioeconomic data in addressing the problem.</p>

<p>“One thing missing from most analyses is the socioeconomic dimension," Trudeau said. "Adding that layer could reveal how intersecting factors like poverty and unemployment contribute to over-policing in certain communities.”</p>

<p>The impact of police violence also extends beyond individual incidents, creating ripple effects in affected communities. Trudeau noted that persistent exposure to police violence undermines trust in law enforcement and fuels cycles of fear and alienation.</p>

<p>Moskos adds that the best correlation for police data is community violence, which tends to be higher in lower income areas and tends to be people of color.
According to <em>The Washington Post</em> data 5% of fatal police shootings in the time data was collected was of unarmed people. But there are many other cases where the victim was armed with a gun, blunt object or knife, or had a car, that complicate tracking police accountability.</p>

<p>Moskos believes analyzing the shootings comes down to a case-by-case basis. 
“The issue isn't whether the person is armed. The issue is whether the person is a threat,” Moskos said. “...You can be unarmed and be an imminent threat or you can have a weapon and not be an imminent threat.</p>

<p>Moskos also stresses that <em>The Washington Post</em> data only tracks who cops shoot and kill rather than taser and kill or kill with their bare hands or a vehicle. He likes the shoot and kill data since it’s subjective.</p>

<p>Moskos noted that <em>The Washington Post</em> used to have a column in the police shootings data set that noted if the shooting was justified. But when it adjudged the majority of them were justified, even by their standards, it removed the variable. To accurately judge if a shooting is warranted, Moskos and Trudeau stress the importance of body cameras to ensure transparency.</p>

<p>Yet data from <em>The Washington Post</em> reveals a startling reality: body cameras are activated in less than 20% of police shootings.</p>

<p>“That statistic is shocking but not surprising,” Moskos said. 
Moskos emphasized the expensive price of body cameras — though he floated the federal government’s possibility of giving the money — and the legal compilations of releasing body camera footage after an event with people’s right to privacy.</p>

<p>“The selective release of footage by departments only deepens public mistrust,” Trudeau said. “Without laws requiring timely disclosure, body cameras lose much of their potential impact.”</p>

<div class="story">
<p>Beyond body cameras, the reluctance of police departments to release footage or other evidence after incidents of violence exacerbates public skepticism. Moskos stressed that this opacity reflects a larger cultural issue within law enforcement, where officers are trained to shield themselves from liability.</p>

<p>“We need to shift the culture toward transparency,” Moskos said. “If police departments were required to release evidence within a set timeframe, it would send a clear message that accountability is non-negotiable.”</p>

<p>Another trend in police shootings Moskos identified in <em>The Washington Post</em> data was the targeting of people with mental illness. Just under 20% of victims were tracked to have a mental illness.</p>

<p>“Keep in mind, this is not like going into doctors records,” Moskos said. “And you know, guys suffer from seasonal depression, mental illness. This is so mentally ill that in the newspaper account, the neighbor says, that guy is crazy. He's always doing shit. That 20% is extremely visibly mentally ill, because it's counted people. So I mean, that's a really high percentage.”</p>

<p>Since the racial justice protests of 2020, policing in the United States has faced increased scrutiny. While some departments have implemented reforms, many others are struggling with high rates of retirements and recruitment challenges.</p>

<p>“Replacing experienced officers with less experienced ones creates a vacuum of knowledge and training,” Moskos said, underscoring the importance of stability in police forces.</p>

<p>However, he noted that younger recruits may also bring fresh perspectives to policing, potentially driving cultural shifts over time.</p>

<p>One proposed solution is increasing pay for police officers, which could attract more qualified candidates and reduce corruption.</p>

<p>“Higher salaries could help,” Trudeau said, “but it’s not a cure-all. Systemic reforms, including better training and community involvement, are equally critical.”</p>

<p>Training, in particular, has emerged as a key area for improvement. Moskos pointed to the success of de-escalation programs in reducing violent encounters. 
“When officers are equipped with the right tools and mindsets, they’re less likely to resort to force unnecessarily.”</p>

<p>Despite the challenges, both experts expressed cautious optimism about the future of policing. Moskos highlighted innovative programs, such as violence interruption and restorative justice initiatives, as steps in the right direction.
However, he warned that without addressing underlying societal issues, progress will remain limited.</p>

<p>“You can’t just pass a law and call it a day," Moskos said. "Laws need teeth, and enforcement mechanisms need to be automatic.”</p>

<p>Addressing police violence and ensuring accountability will require a multifaceted approach that combines better data, stricter laws, and systemic reforms.</p>

<p>“Effective and accountable policing is possible, but it will take sustained effort and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths,” Moskos said.</p>
